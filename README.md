# Terraform Enterprise Health Assessment

Terraform Enterprise/Terraform Cloud have the option of a Health Assessment on workspaces. This is divided into 2 things

Drift detection determines whether your real-world infrastructure matches your Terraform state file.

Continuous validation determines whether custom conditions in the workspaceâ€™s configuration continue to pass after Terraform provisions the infrastructure.
